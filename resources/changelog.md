MITRE Shield was updated to use MITRE ATT&CK v8. This includes:

* New ATT&CK Tactics of [Reconnaissance](http://localhost:4000/attack_mapping/TA0043/) and [Resource Development](http://localhost:4000/attack_mapping/TA0042/)
* New ATT&CK Techniques
    * Not all new ATT&CK Techniques were mapped to Shield Techniques. If you have suggestions for mappings, please see our [Contributing]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/contribute) documentation.

We also added new [Adversary Group Mappings](http://localhost:4000/attack_groups/) based on ATT&CK Groups, and expanded the definition of [Hunting]({{ site.baseurl }}/techniques/DTE0021) to be more proactive.

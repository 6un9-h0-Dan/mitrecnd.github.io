As defenders, we see value in mapping active defense techniques to ATT&CK®. In this section of the site, each tactic in the ATT&CK framework is shown individually.  Clicking on a specific tactic in the ATT&CK Mapping menu will show a detail page with the following information:

* ATT&CK ID & Name – The ATT&CK technique ID and Name.
*	Opportunity Space – High-level active defense possibilities introduced when attackers employ their techniques.
*	Active Defense Technique – The specific technique being applied.
*	Use Case – A high-level description of how a defender could do something to take advantage of the opportunity that the attackers action presents.

Note: Depending on your needs, it is possible to apply multiple active defense techniques; therefore, multiple lines may be visible for each ATT&CK ID.

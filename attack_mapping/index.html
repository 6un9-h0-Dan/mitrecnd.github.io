    <p>
        As defenders, we see value in mapping active defense techniques to ATT&CK. In this section of the site, each tactic in the ATT&CK framework is shown individually.  Clicking on a specific tactic in the ATT&CK Mapping menu will show a detail page with the following information:
        <ul>
            <li>ATT&CK ID & Name – The ATT&CK technique ID and Name.</li>
            <li>Opportunity Space – High-level active defense possibilities introduced when attackers employ their techniques.</li>
            <li>Active Defense Technique – The specific technique being applied.</li>
            <li>Use Case – A high-level description of how a defender could do something to take advantage of the opportunity that the attackers action presents.</li>
        </ul>
        Note: Depending on your needs, it is possible to apply multiple active defense techniques; therefore, multiple lines may be visible for each ATT&CK ID. Below you can find our ATT&CK mapping broken down by ATT&CK tactic. Alternatively, the complete mapping on a single page can be <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/attack_mapping/mapping_all">found here</a>.

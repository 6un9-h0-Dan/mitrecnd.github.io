Shield is an active defense knowledge base MITRE is developing to capture and organize what we are learning about active defense and adversary engagement.  Derived from over 10 years of adversary engagement experience, it spans the range from high level, CISO ready considerations of opportunities and objectives, to practitioner friendly discussions of the TTPs available to defenders. We are developing this knowledge base as both unstructured (think writings like blogs and papers) and structured (think tables of things, related to each other with links) data.  Our first release (see more below) focuses on the structured elements.  Working with the data can be awkward, so our presentation here is in the form of a couple of organizing views or \u201cmappings\u201d, including a mapping between MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae and Shield.  We foresee additional views into the knowledge base we are developing. Shield is very much a work in progress; it is being released now not because it is complete, but because we think it is ready enough to stimulate conversations about active defense, adversary engagement, and the ways defenders can use them to change the game. What\u2019s Active Defense? The U.S. Department of Defense defines active defense as \u201cThe employment of limited offensive action and counterattacks to deny a contested area or position to the enemy.\u201d1 Active defense ranges from basic cyber defensive capabilities to cyber deception and adversary engagement operations.  The combination of these defenses allows an organization to not only counter current attacks but also to learn more about that adversary and better prepare for new attacks in the future. What\u2019s New? Well, everything here is new! To begin with, you will find several different views into the Shield knowledge base. Across the top, dropdown menus are available to access the site\u2019s information quickly and easily. More details about these views are detailed separately. One way we are using Shield is to tie ATT&CK techniques describing post-compromise adversary behavior to relevant Shield defensive techniques. We are excited to share this mapping of ATT&CK to Shield. What\u2019s Next? First and foremost, we are hoping for conversation.  Our work is in service of a safer world, and we are interested in talking to others that think active defense and adversary engagement might be useful paths to that goal. For the knowledge base, we have already seen opportunities in tweaking our data model, that is next, and we hope to share it in the 4th quarter of 2020.  As we continue to work with opportunity spaces, use cases, and procedures we see a natural progression to develop a playbook. Of course, there will be additional knowledge base content.  For the record, this will likely never be close to finished; the subject area is nearly infinite and limited more by imagination than anything.  We do hope to analyze the coverage we are giving the landscape and ensure that we are including at least a bit of every type of thing that needs exposure. How Do I Contribute? We are very interested in feedback and suggestions.

In this section of the site, each tactic in the ATT&CK framework is shown individually.  Clicking on a specific tactic in the ATT&CK Mapping menu will show a detail page with the following information:  ATT&CK ID & Name \u2013 The ATT&CK technique ID and Name. Opportunity Space \u2013 High-level active defense possibilities introduced when attackers employ their techniques. Active Defense Technique \u2013 The specific technique being applied. Use Case \u2013 A high-level description of how a defender could do something to take advantage of the opportunity that the attackers action presents.

Shield is a verb meaning to protect from a danger or risk, as well as a noun, meaning one that protects or defends. Like the word, our Shield knowledge base can be used in a variety of ways depending on a defender\u2019s exact need.        What was the motivation behind the creation of Shield?      This project began as the team documented techniques that could be useful in adversary engagement operations.  MITRE has a rich history of work in cyber deception and adversary engagement so for the team, creating this knowledge base was a natural progression.        Shield seems geared towards deception and adversary engagement, but also includes some basic defense techniques.  Why is that?      To be successful at deception and adversary engagement, you must use basic cyber defense techniques like collecting system and network logs, PCAP, performing data backups, etc.        What is the difference between an \"Opportunity Space\" and a \"Use Case\" in the active defense knowledge base?      Opportunity Spaces are high-level active defense posibilities when attackers employ their techniques, while Use Cases are high-level descriptions of how a defender could do something to take advantage of the opportunity that the attackers action presents.        Have you considered other methods of presenting the Shield data such as creating an ATT&CK Navigator layer?      We see the possibility of a future enhancement in this area. If you would find this to be useful or would like to contribute to this effort, please contact us.        How can I programmatically work with your data and/or see how the site is generated?      All of the data used to generate this website can be found on our GitHub repo. The JSON data specifically can be found in the _data folder.         <!--"}, {"id": 20, "title": "Getting Started", "path": "/resources/getting-started.html", "content": "-->   Papers  Introduction Paper: This whitepaper provides an introduction to MITRE Shield and how it relates to MITRE ATT&CK.  About Shield\u2019s structure and terminology A goal for Shield was to employ enough structure and rigor to be useful scientifically and to the practitioner, without becoming needlessly rigid or complex. We began with terminology found in the DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, as well as the United States Government Compendium of Interagency and Associated Terms:  Active Defense \u2014 The employment of limited offensive action and counterattacks to deny a contested area or position to the enemy. Strategy \u2014 A prudent idea or set of ideas for employing the instruments of national power in a synchronized and integrated fashion to achieve theater, national, and/or multinational objectives. Tactics \u2014 The employment and ordered arrangement of forces in relation to each other. Techniques \u2014 Non-prescriptive ways or methods used to perform missions, functions, or tasks. Procedures \u2014 Standard, detailed steps that prescribe how to perform specific tasks.  We modified those terms to fit the domain of cyber active defense.   Our definitions:  Tactics are abstract defender goals. We have found it useful to have a categorization system that can describe the utility or purpose of various other elements in the knowledge base.  For example, the tactic \u201cchannel\u201d could be associated with a specific technique, or part of a planned set of techniques, or even part of an overall long-term engagement strategy. Techniques are general actions that can be performed by a defender. A technique may have several different tactical effects depending on how they are implemented. Procedures are implementations of a technique. In this release, we only include simple procedures to inspire additional thinking. Our goal is to not advocate for specific products, solutions, or outcomes, but to prompt organizations to think broadly about options that exist. The dataset included in Shield is by necessity incomplete, because too many possible variations exist to reliably document.  We also added some new terms:  Opportunity Spaces, which describe high-level active defense possibilities introduced when attackers employ their techniques. Use Cases, which are high-level descriptions of how a defender could do something to take advantage of the opportunity that the attacker\u2019s action presents.   Use cases are helpful to move toward a specific implementation discussion. Note: We see a natural evolution of use cases becoming into plays in the next release of the knowledge base.  Using the Website This site presents several different views into the Shield knowledge base across the top. Dropdown menus are available to access the site\u2019s information quickly and easily. There is a matrix view, which provides a quick visual depiction of active defense tactics and techniques. Menus for both tactic and technique views are available for those wanting to go straight to a specific item.  The ATT&CK Mapping section of Shield contains a list of the adversary tactics found in the ATT&CK framework.  Each ATT&CK tactic has a dedicated page which lists the associated adversary techniques and how active defense can be applied to each one.   <!--"}, {"id": 21, "title": "Privacy", "path": "/resources/privacy.html", "content": "-->   PRIVACY POLICY Effective Date: August 12, 2020 The MITRE Corporation (\u201cMITRE\u201d) respects the privacy of its website users.

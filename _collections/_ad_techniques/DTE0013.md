description: "Deploy a set of decoy systems with different OS and software configurations."
long_description: "Decoy diversity is the deployment of decoy systems with varying Operating Systems and software configurations. Most enterprise networks contain systems which utilize different types and versions of operating systems and applications (Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Linux, Microsoft Office, Adobe Reader, etc.)  Deploying decoy systems with such variations allows you to present a realistic environment to an adversary.  It also allows you to see if they use different TTPs on systems with different configurations."

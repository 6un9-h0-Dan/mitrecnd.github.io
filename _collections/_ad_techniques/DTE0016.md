description: "Execute software on a target system for the purposes of the defender."
long_description: "Executing software will create a system process (either ephemeral or perpetual) on the target system, which can be used to influence the perception or action of an adversary.   A decoy process could do things including give the impression of either a more or less secure system, the presence of attackable services or defensive infrastructure, or suggest the supposed purpose or use of the target machine."

long_description: "A decoy persona is used to establish background information about a user.  In order to have the adversary believe they are operating against real targets (people and IT), develop a backstory about a user and plant data to support that backstory.  Depending on the need for realism, the constructed persona can be supported by evidence of hobbies, social and professional interactions, consumer transactions, employment, etc.  "

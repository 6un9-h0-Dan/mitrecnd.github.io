_name: "Hunting"
description: "Search for the presence of or information about an adversary, or your organization, its employees, infrastructure, etc."
long_description: "Within the defender's environments, hunting presupposes a failure of initial prevention or detection, and that an adversary has successfully penetrated a system. In this case defenders hunt for the presence of an adversary. Typically the hunt is informed by intelligence on adversary TTPs and infrastructure. Defenders also hunt adversaries outside the defended environment. Information about the adversary, including their skills, TTPs, and infrastructure can be used to improve defenses or promote better adversary engagement. Defenders also hunt for information about their organization that is available for free or for purchase. Actively researching organizational exposure or inclusion in password dumps, leaks, etc. helps defenders focus on specific detections and proactive countermeasures."

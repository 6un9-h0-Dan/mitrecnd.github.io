_name: "Hunting"
description: "The process of searching for the presence of or information about an adversary.  "
long_description: "Typically the search is informed by intelligence on adversary TTPs and infrastructure.   Within the defender's environments, hunting presupposes a failure of initial prevention or detection, and that an adversary has successfully penetrated a system.  In this case defenders hunt for the presence of an adversary.  Defenders also hunt adversaries outside the defended environment.  Information about the adversary, including their skills, TTPs, and infrastructure can be used to improve defenses or promote better adversary engagement."

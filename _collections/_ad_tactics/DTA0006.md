long_description: "Facilitate is used to enable an adversary to conduct part or all of their mission.  This could include using unpatched versions of operating systems and software, removing end-point detection software,  and using weak password.  It may also include opening firewall ports, adding proxy capabilities, or introducing elements that an adversary can easily leverage to bypass an obstacle in their operations."

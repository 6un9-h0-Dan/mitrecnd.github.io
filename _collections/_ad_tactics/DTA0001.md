long_description: "Channel is used to guide an adversary down a specific path or in a specific direction.  A defender can channel an adversary away from important systems or network segments and towards decoy systems or hardened devices.  They could also attempt to channel an adversary based on the content that you provide.  Channeling can be used to waste an adversary's time, make them expend additional resources, or allow defenders to study their behaviors."

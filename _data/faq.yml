   questions:
    - question: "Why is the knowledge base named Shield?"
      answer: "Shield is a verb meaning to protect from a danger or risk, as well as a noun, meaning one that protects or defends. Like the word, our Shield knowledge base can be used in a variety of ways depending on a defenderâ€™s exact need."
    - question: "What was the motivation behind the creation of Shield?"
      answer: "This project began as the team documented techniques that could be useful in adversary engagement operations.  MITRE has a rich history of work in cyber deception and adversary engagement so for the team, creating this knowledge base was a natural progression."
    - question: "Shield seems geared towards deception and adversary engagement, but also includes some basic defense techniques.  Why is that?"
      answer: "To be successful at deception and adversary engagement, you must use basic cyber defense techniques like collecting system and network logs, PCAP, performing data backups, etc."
    - question: "What is the difference between an \"Opportunity Space\" and a \"Use Case\" in the active defense knowledge base?"
      answer: "Opportunity Spaces are high-level active defense possibilities when attackers employ their techniques, while Use Cases are high-level descriptions of how a defender could do something to take advantage of the opportunity that the attacker's action presents."
    - question: "Have you considered other methods of presenting the Shield data such as creating an ATT&CK Navigator layer?"
      answer: "We see the possibility of a future enhancement in this area. If you would find this to be useful or would like to contribute to this effort, please contact us."
